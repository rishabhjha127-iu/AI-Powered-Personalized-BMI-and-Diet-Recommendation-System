Title:AI-Powered Personalized BMI and Diet Recommendation System
Phase 1-Completion Phase

Problem Statement
Unhealthy lifestyles spreading as a global epidemic, personalized digital health solutions will help promote consistent engagement. Most people find it hard to understand their BMI or follow through good fitness plans. Existing BMI calculators only show a number without any tips or encouragement for determining sustained care to take.

Proposed Solution

Using AI,system will be able to provide diet and exercise recommendations fitted to that person's body type and lifestyle. A professional report will be created, including an AI-generated before and after visualization to inspire the users. This report will be automatically sent to user through WhatsApp for convenience. On another note, the system will continue to remind users every week with  new diet charts tailored to fit their progress and goal, keeping the user motivated and transformed.

Expected Outcome
The project intends to build an evolving intelligent wellness assistant that uses AI and automation as a means to enable and motivate people for healthier living through data-driven, personalized, and entertaining fitness planning.
